> MODULE [1mansible.builtin.uri[0m (/home/student/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/ansible/modules/uri.py)

  Interacts with HTTP and HTTPS web services and supports Digest, Basic and WSSE HTTP authentication mechanisms.
  For Windows targets, use the [0;33mansible.windows.win_uri[0m module instead.

[1m  * note:[0m This module has a corresponding action plugin.

[1mOPTIONS[0m (red indicates it is required):

   [0;33mattributes[0m  The attributes the resulting filesystem object should have.
               To get supported flags look at the man page for [4mchattr[0m on the target system.
               This string should contain the attributes in the same order as the one displayed by [4mlsattr[0m.
               The [1;30m`='[0m operator is assumed as default, otherwise [1;30m`+'[0m or [1;30m`-'[0m operators need to be included in the
               string.
        aliases: [attr]
        default: null
        type: str

   [0;33mbody[0m    The body of the http request/response to the web service. If `body_format' is set to `json' it will take an already formatted JSON string or
           convert a data structure into JSON.
           If `body_format' is set to `form-urlencoded' it will convert a dictionary or list of tuples into an 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
           string. (Added in v2.7)
           If `body_format' is set to `form-multipart' it will convert a dictionary into 'multipart/form-multipart' body. (Added in v2.10)
        default: null
        type: raw

   [0;33mbody_format[0m  The serialization format of the body. When set to `json', `form-multipart', or `form-urlencoded', encodes the body argument, if needed, and
                automatically sets the Content-Type header accordingly.
                As of v2.3 it is possible to override the [1;30m`Content-Type'[0m header, when set to `json' or `form-urlencoded' via the `headers'
                option.
                The 'Content-Type' header cannot be overridden when using `form-multipart'
                `form-urlencoded' was added in v2.7.
                `form-multipart' was added in v2.10.
        choices: [form-urlencoded, json, raw, form-multipart]
        default: raw
        type: str

   [0;33mca_path[0m  PEM formatted file that contains a CA certificate to be used for validation
        default: null
        type: path

   [0;33mciphers[0m  SSL/TLS Ciphers to use for the request.
            When a list is provided, all ciphers are joined in order with `:'
            See the OpenSSL Cipher List Format <https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/openssl-ciphers.html#CIPHER-LIST-FORMAT> for more
            details.
            The available ciphers is dependent on the Python and OpenSSL/LibreSSL versions
        default: null
        elements: str
        type: list

   [0;33mclient_cert[0m  PEM formatted certificate chain file to be used for SSL client authentication.
                This file can also include the key as well, and if the key is included, `client_key' is not required
        default: null
        type: path

   [0;33mclient_key[0m  PEM formatted file that contains your private key to be used for SSL client authentication.
               If `client_cert' contains both the certificate and key, this option is not required.
        default: null
        type: path

   [0;33mcreates[0m  A filename, when it already exists, this step will not be run.
        default: null
        type: path

   [0;33mdecompress[0m  Whether to attempt to decompress gzip content-encoded responses
        default: true
        type: bool

   [0;33mdest[0m    A path of where to download the file to (if desired). If `dest' is a directory, the basename of the file on the remote server will be used.
        default: null
        type: path

   [0;33mfollow_redirects[0m  Whether or not the URI module should follow redirects.
        choices:
          all: Will follow all redirects.
          'no': (DEPRECATED, will be removed in the future version) alias of `none'.
          none: Will not follow any redirects.
          safe: Only redirects doing GET or HEAD requests will be followed.
          urllib2: Defer to urllib2 behavior (As of writing this follows HTTP redirects).
          'yes': (DEPRECATED, will be removed in the future version) alias of `all'.
        default: safe
        type: str

   [0;33mforce[0m   If `true' do not get a cached copy.
        default: false
        type: bool

   [0;33mforce_basic_auth[0m  Force the sending of the Basic authentication header upon initial request.
                     When this setting is `false', this module will first try an unauthenticated request, and when the server replies with an
                     [1;30m`HTTP 401'[0m error, it will submit the Basic authentication header.
                     When this setting is `true', this module will immediately send a Basic authentication header on the first request.
                     Use this setting in any of the following scenarios:
                     You know the webservice endpoint always requires HTTP Basic authentication, and you want to speed up your requests by
                     eliminating the first roundtrip.
                     The web service does not properly send an HTTP 401 error to your client, so Ansible's HTTP library will not properly respond
                     with HTTP credentials, and logins will fail.
                     The webservice bans or rate-limits clients that cause any HTTP 401 errors.
        default: false
        type: bool

   [0;33mgroup[0m   Name of the group that should own the filesystem object, as would be fed to [4mchown[0m.
           When left unspecified, it uses the current group of the current user unless you are root, in which case it can preserve the previous
           ownership.
        default: null
        type: str

   [0;33mheaders[0m  Add custom HTTP headers to a request in the format of a YAML hash. As of Ansible 2.3 supplying [1;30m`Content-Type'[0m here will override the
            header generated by supplying `json' or `form-urlencoded' for `body_format'.
        default: {}
        type: dict

   [0;33mhttp_agent[0m  Header to identify as, generally appears in web server logs.
        default: ansible-httpget
        type: str

   [0;33mmethod[0m  The HTTP method of the request or response.
           In more recent versions we do not restrict the method at the module level anymore but it still must be a valid method accepted by the
           service handling the request.
        default: GET
        type: str

   [0;33mmode[0m    The permissions the resulting filesystem object should have.
           For those used to [4m/usr/bin/chmod[0m remember that modes are actually octal numbers. You must give Ansible enough information to parse
           them correctly. For consistent results, quote octal numbers (for example, `'644'' or `'1777'') so Ansible receives a string and can do its
           own conversion from string into number. Adding a leading zero (for example, `0755') works sometimes, but can fail in loops and some other
           circumstances.
           Giving Ansible a number without following either of these rules will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected results.
           As of Ansible 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode (for example, `u+rwx' or `u=rw,g=r,o=r').
           If `mode' is not specified and the destination filesystem object [1mdoes not[0m exist, the default [1;30m`umask'[0m on the system will
           be used when setting the mode for the newly created filesystem object.
           If `mode' is not specified and the destination filesystem object [1mdoes[0m exist, the mode of the existing filesystem object will be
           used.
           Specifying `mode' is the best way to ensure filesystem objects are created with the correct permissions. See CVE-2020-1736 for further
           details.
        default: null
        type: raw

   [0;33mowner[0m   Name of the user that should own the filesystem object, as would be fed to [4mchown[0m.
           When left unspecified, it uses the current user unless you are root, in which case it can preserve the previous ownership.
           Specifying a numeric username will be assumed to be a user ID and not a username. Avoid numeric usernames to avoid this confusion.
        default: null
        type: str

   [0;33mremote_src[0m  If `false', the module will search for the `src' on the controller node.
               If `true', the module will search for the `src' on the managed (remote) node.
        default: false
        type: bool

   [0;33mremoves[0m  A filename, when it does not exist, this step will not be run.
        default: null
        type: path

   [0;33mreturn_content[0m  Whether or not to return the body of the response as a "content" key in the dictionary result no matter it succeeded or failed.
                   Independently of this option, if the reported Content-type is "application/json", then the JSON is always loaded into a key called
                   `json' in the dictionary results.
        default: false
        type: bool

   [0;33mselevel[0m  The level part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
            This is the MLS/MCS attribute, sometimes known as the [1;30m`range'[0m.
            When set to `_default', it will use the [1;30m`level'[0m portion of the policy if available.
        default: null
        type: str

   [0;33mserole[0m  The role part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
           When set to `_default', it will use the [1;30m`role'[0m portion of the policy if available.
        default: null
        type: str

   [0;33msetype[0m  The type part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
           When set to `_default', it will use the [1;30m`type'[0m portion of the policy if available.
        default: null
        type: str

   [0;33mseuser[0m  The user part of the SELinux filesystem object context.
           By default it uses the `system' policy, where applicable.
           When set to `_default', it will use the [1;30m`user'[0m portion of the policy if available.
        default: null
        type: str

   [0;33msrc[0m     Path to file to be submitted to the remote server.
           Cannot be used with `body'.
           Should be used with `force_basic_auth' to ensure success when the remote end sends a 401.
        default: null
        type: path

   [0;33mstatus_code[0m  A list of valid, numeric, HTTP status codes that signifies success of the request.
        default: [200]
        elements: int
        type: list

   [0;33mtimeout[0m  The socket level timeout in seconds
        default: 30
        type: int

   [0;33munix_socket[0m  Path to Unix domain socket to use for connection
        default: null
        type: path

   [0;33munredirected_headers[0m  A list of header names that will not be sent on subsequent redirected requests. This list is case insensitive. By default all headers will be
                         redirected. In some cases it may be beneficial to list headers such as [1;30m`Authorization'[0m here to avoid potential
                         credential exposure.
        default: []
        elements: str
        type: list

   [0;33munsafe_writes[0m  Influence when to use atomic operation to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target filesystem object.
                  By default this module uses atomic operations to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target filesystem objects,
                  but sometimes systems are configured or just broken in ways that prevent this. One example is docker mounted filesystem objects,
                  which cannot be updated atomically from inside the container and can only be written in an unsafe manner.
                  This option allows Ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of updating filesystem objects when atomic operations fail (however, it
                  doesn't force Ansible to perform unsafe writes).
                  IMPORTANT! Unsafe writes are subject to race conditions and can lead to data corruption.
        default: false
        type: bool

   [0;31m[1murl[0m[0m     HTTP or HTTPS URL in the form (http|https)://host.domain[:port]/path
        type: str

   [0;33murl_password[0m  A password for the module to use for Digest, Basic or WSSE authentication.
        aliases: [password]
        default: null
        type: str

   [0;33murl_username[0m  A username for the module to use for Digest, Basic or WSSE authentication.
        aliases: [user]
        default: null
        type: str

   [0;33muse_gssapi[0m  Use GSSAPI to perform the authentication, typically this is for Kerberos or Kerberos through Negotiate authentication.
               Requires the Python library gssapi <https://github.com/pythongssapi/python-gssapi> to be installed.
               Credentials for GSSAPI can be specified with `url_username'/`url_password' or with the GSSAPI env var [1;30m`KRB5CCNAME'[0m that
               specified a custom Kerberos credential cache.
               NTLM authentication is [1mnot[0m supported even if the GSSAPI mech for NTLM has been installed.
        default: false
        type: bool

   [0;33muse_netrc[0m  Determining whether to use credentials from ``~/.netrc`` file
              By default .netrc is used with Basic authentication headers
              When set to False, .netrc credentials are ignored
        default: true
        type: bool

   [0;33muse_proxy[0m  If `false', it will not use a proxy, even if one is defined in an environment variable on the target hosts.
        default: true
        type: bool

   [0;33mvalidate_certs[0m  If `false', SSL certificates will not be validated.
                   This should only set to `false' used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.
                   Prior to 1.9.2 the code defaulted to `false'.
        default: true
        type: bool
